# More colors

Manim defines quite a few different color shades, but sometimes the color you want might just not be in there. 
There are some established color palettes around, personally I most often use the X11 colors in my LaTeX documents.

Here I upload some python "libraries" which can be used to import some of the palettes from https://www.w3schools.com/colors/
